## ✨ Why This Extension?

Nowadays, users often open **two or more side-by-side ChatGPT windows** to cross-reference answers or take notes.  
This workflow has a few issues:

- ❌ **Context is lost**: You can’t automatically link your questions and answers across multiple tabs.  
- ❌ **Screen clutter**: Multiple windows consume valuable screen space, making it hard to focus.  
- ❌ **Messy workflow**: Switching back and forth reduces efficiency.  

**Disposable ChatGPT Popup** solves this problem by giving you a **temporary, draggable popup** that:

- Opens right on the page you are reading  
- Keeps previous ChatGPT context intact  
- Disappears once closed  
- **Does not require API keys**  
- **Is completely free — no subscription or payment needed**  



## 🚀 Features

- **Temporary Chat:** Each popup is a disposable session.  
- **Alt+Select Shortcut:** Highlight text while holding **Alt** to open the popup instantly.  
- **Draggable & Resizable:** Customize position and size freely.  
- **Context Awareness:** Pulls associated ChatGPT context for better explanations.  
- **No API Keys Needed:** Works directly inside ChatGPT’s web interface.  
- **Plug & Play:** Just add the extension, and it’s ready to use.
